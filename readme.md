# Preauth Coding Challenge Submission üöÄ

This repository contains my submission for the **Preauth Technical Challenge**.

It includes solutions to both proposed problems:

- [`Don't Permute`](./game-01)
- [`Spaghetti Code (Gilded Rose)`](./game-02)

## How the solutions are structured

Each challenge lives in its own folder (`game-01` and `game-02` respectively). Inside each you'll find:
- Clean, self-documented code.
- A detailed write-up describing the approach and testing strategy.
- Unit tests covering edge cases and expected behaviors.

## Evaluation Criteria (Revisited)

‚úîÔ∏è **Good Code Practices**: Solutions follow principles like SOLID, clean code, and self-explanatory logic.

‚úîÔ∏è **Self-Documentation**: No need for external documentation to understand what each class or function does.

‚úîÔ∏è **Efficiency**: Code is optimized for performance and memory usage within the context of the problem.

‚úîÔ∏è **Testability**: Each solution includes complete test coverage.
